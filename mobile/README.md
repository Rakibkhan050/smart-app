# Mobile (Flutter) — Placeholder

This folder will hold a Flutter app in the future. Notes:
- Use Flutter for cross-platform mobile app
- Implement push notification handling and background sync
- Authentication via JWT; reuse backend endpoints
- Localizations: en + ar (RTL support)

For now this is a placeholder for later implementation.
